## Phone to Objective Adapters
![Objective Adapter](/Pixel3/Pixel3_to_RMS_objective.jpg)
These are organized by type of phone. Currently there is only `/Pixel3`
The `_to_RMS` design is sized to take an M25 to RMS adapter, and then the RMS-threaded objective screws into that. No reason you couldn't resize that inner diameter and go direct, though.

## Phone to Stereo Zoom Microscope
These are also sorted by phone.
The current one is sized for the 10X 20mm eyepieces that are standard on the scopes, and hence are named in the `_to_10x20_Eyepiece` format

## Cuvette
I was tired of image distortions from whatever I'd put the subject in, so created this enclosure inspired by spectroscopy cuvettes. It's designed to take either 50x75mm (2"x3") large microscope slides as the walls, or you can stack two of the standard 25x75mm (1"x3") slides. There's also a recessed area in the top for an additional slide to be the lid.

Most slides seem to be the ~1mm thick style, but there's also an STL for the 1.3mm thick ones I happen to have around.

## Tiny World Tube Stand
Cute stand for 100mm plastic screw top test tubes, in 33mm diameter. Part is intended to be lasercut, but could also be 3D printed. It also has a hole for a 3/16" brass rod, optimally 4.7" long but hey whatever ya got.
